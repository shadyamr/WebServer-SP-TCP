# WebServer-SP-TCP
Web Server with Socket Programming using TCP (Python)

Final team project for CSC230 - Computer Networks [SPRING 2022]

# About The Project
It is coded in Python using Socket Programming through TCP Connections.

The web server handles one HTTP request at a time as the server should accept and parse the HTTP request, get the requested file from the server's file system, create an HTTP response message consisting of the requested file preceded by header lines, and then send the response directly to the client. If the requested file is not present in the server, the server should send an HTTP "404 - Page Nott Found" message back to the client.
